        </ul>
        <h4>For the Béchamel Sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Eggplant:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Slice the eggplants into rounds, sprinkle with salt, and let them sit for about 30 minutes to draw out excess moisture.</li>
                <li>Rinse the eggplant slices and pat them dry. Brush with olive oil and grill or bake until golden brown. Set aside.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large pan, sauté the chopped onion in olive oil until softened. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
                <li>Add the ground meat and cook until browned.</li>
                <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes, red wine (if using), oregano, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 20-30 minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and whisk continuously to make a roux.</li>
                <li>Gradually pour in the warm milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.</li>
                <li>Add a pinch of nutmeg, salt, and black pepper. Continue to cook and whisk until the sauce thickens.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and then slowly add them to the béchamel, whisking constantly.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Assemble the Moussaka:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>In a greased baking dish, layer half of the grilled eggplant slices.</li>
                <li>Add the meat sauce on top of the eggplant layer.</li>
                <li>Add another layer of the remaining eggplant slices.</li>
                <li>Pour the béchamel sauce over the top, spreading it evenly.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bake:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-55 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the moussaka is cooked through.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Serve:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the moussaka to rest for 15-20 minutes before slicing.</li>
                <li>Serve warm and enjoy your delicious Greek moussaka!</li>
            </ul>
